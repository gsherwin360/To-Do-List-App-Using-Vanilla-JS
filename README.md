Building To-Do List App using Vanilla JS

What is a ToDo List? The definition is a simple one. It's a list of tasks you need to complete, or things that you want to do. 

In this Project, the user can add a To-do by filling the input and hit ENTER, after that he can rather check the To-Do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.

There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user.
